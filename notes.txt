DAO: decentralized autonomous organizaiotn
NFT: 


https://etherscan.io/ : view address, transacction on chain

Transaction fee = Gas Price x Gas fee
    node running bchain get paid this fee. based on Gas used

Gas PRice: 
    cost per unit of gas spent.
    Changes.
    more transactions -> more busy chan -> more gas fee

ETH uses KEccak-256 algo


nonce(no of transactions): a variable value  to be found. it is hashed with data.
ex: nonce+ data = Hash
adjust nonce to make Hash start with 0x0000

Genesis block : first block in chain 

peer to peer chain:
all chain[i] have same hash

Mining: finding solution to blockchain

Publuc key: elepticaal curve digital signature algo

signature: private key used to sign. Public to verify 
public key makes the address on chain

1 ether = 1B Gwei = 10^9B wei
some ether burns in txn

consensus: mechanism used to reached on state in bchain
chain selection or Sybil resisant algo

2 Sybil resisant algo

Proof of werk

Proof of stake
